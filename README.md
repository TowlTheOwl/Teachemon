# Teachemon
Teachemon is a card-based game that uses concepts from Pokemon, to make a video game that connects the Newport High School Community.

The cards consist of teachers from the school, and each teachers have their own unique abilities that are associated with their identity. 

The game is built mainly using python and socket, with other python dependencies.


## Instructions to run the code:
/server is independent from rest of the code, as it is a code for server host.

1. Make sure the server is hosted. Run server.py in the server directory, and the code should print "Listening..." when it is connected

2. Run main game code, by running main.py in the main directory.
